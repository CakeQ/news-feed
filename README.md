Client project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Setup

In order to run both the client and server, you will need to go into both the /client directory and the /server directory and run a `npm install`, as well as run another `npm install` in the root directory.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app and the server concurrently in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits to the client.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner for the client in the interactive watch mode.
